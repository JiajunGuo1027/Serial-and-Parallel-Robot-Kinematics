# Serial-and-Parallel-Robot-Kinematics
UFMF4X-15-M Robotic Fundamentals Coursework. The coursework consists of three main parts related to **serial and parallel robot kinematics**:

## **PART I: Forward and Inverse Kinematics for Lynxmotion Arm**
**Tasks:**
1. **Derive Forward Kinematics:**
   - Use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameter method.
   - Report all steps and investigations.
   - Utilize MATLAB and reference lecture materials.

2. **Workspace Analysis:**
   - Analyze the workspace of the wrist (5th joint) while preceding joints move through their range.
   - Plot 2D and 3D views of the workspace.

3. **Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Derive an analytical solution for the inverse kinematics.

This part focuses on understanding the basic kinematic modeling principles of the Lynxmotion robotic arm, which involves calculating joint-to-end-effector transformations (forward kinematics) and the reverse (inverse kinematics). Workspace analysis provides insights into the robot's reach and flexibility.

## **PART II: Task Planning and Trajectory Implementation**
**Tasks:**
1. **Plan a Task:**
   - Define a task in MATLAB requiring at least 5 end-effector positions and orientations in 3D space.

2. **Solve Inverse Kinematics:**
   - Compute joint coordinates for the planned task.

3. **Trajectory Design:**
   - Implement three different trajectories between Cartesian points:
     - Free motion.
     - Straight-line trajectory.
     - Obstacle avoidance trajectory with a defined object (e.g., a cylinder between points).

This part emphasizes task planning and trajectory generation, requiring students to program and simulate motion paths. This applies theoretical knowledge to practical challenges such as obstacle avoidance and path optimization.

## **PART III: Parallel Manipulator Kinematics**
